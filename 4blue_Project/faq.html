  <div class="faq-list" role="list">
    <details role="listitem">
      <summary>1. How far in advance should I book an appointment?</summary>
      <div class="answer">
        We recommend booking **1–2 weeks in advance** to secure your preferred stylist and time. We do accept last-minute bookings when possible—call or use our online booking system to check availability.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details role="listitem">
      <summary>2. What should I do before a colour appointment?</summary>
      <div class="answer">
        Arrive with **clean, dry hair** that isn’t freshly washed the same day. Avoid heavy oils or styling products as they can affect colour processing. If you’re unsure, book a short consultation beforehand.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details role="listitem">
      <summary>3. Do you offer consultations for major changes (colour or cut)?</summary>
      <div class="answer">
        Yes — we offer **complimentary consultations** for major transformations, extensions, and corrective colour. This helps us align on expectations and recommend the best approach for your hair goals.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details role="listitem">
      <summary>4. Which brands and products do you use?</summary>
      <div class="answer">
        We use trusted, high-performance lines that prioritise hair health and sustainability, including **Kevin Murphy**, **K18**, and other premium professional ranges — chosen to deliver lasting, healthy results.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details role="listitem">
      <summary>5. Do you have treatments for damaged or fragile hair?</summary>
      <div class="answer">
        Absolutely. We provide tailored repair treatments such as **K18**, keratin smoothing, and deep-repair masks to restore strength, shine, and manageability. Ask your stylist for a recommendation during your appointment.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details role="listitem">
      <summary>6. What is your cancellation policy?</summary>
      <div class="answer">
        We kindly request **at least 24 hours’ notice** for cancellations or rescheduling. This allows us to offer the time slot to another client. Late cancellations or no-shows may be subject to a fee.
      </div>
    </details>
  
    <details role="listitem">
      <summary>7. What is the best treatment for damaged or dry hair?</summary>
      <div class="answer">
        For dry or damaged hair, we recommend a deep conditioning or keratin treatment. These treatments restore moisture, repair broken strands, and leave your hair feeling soft and silky. Our stylists can assess your hair type and suggest the best treatment to bring your locks back to life.
