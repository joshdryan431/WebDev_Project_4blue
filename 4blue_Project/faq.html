    <details role="listitem">
      <summary>1. How far in advance should I book an appointment?</summary>
      <div class="answer">
        We recommend booking **1–2 weeks in advance** to secure your preferred stylist and time. We do accept last-minute bookings when possible—call or use our online booking system to check availability.

    <details role="listitem">
      <summary>2. What should I do before a colour appointment?</summary>
      <div class="answer">
        Arrive with **clean, dry hair** that isn’t freshly washed the same day. Avoid heavy oils or styling products as they can affect colour processing. If you’re unsure, book a short consultation beforehand.

        Yes — we offer **complimentary consultations** for major transformations, extensions, and corrective colour. This helps us align on expectations and recommend the best approach for your hair goals.

      <summary>6. What is your cancellation policy?</summary>
      <div class="answer">
        We kindly request **at least 24 hours’ notice** for cancellations or rescheduling. This allows us to offer the time slot to another client. Late cancellations or no-shows may be subject to a fee.
